# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

<!-- I used axios because axios give automatic JSON parsing and better browser compatibility -->


<!-- If i will get more 4 hours, 
I will write eslint, it's setup and pre commit hooks.
will write proper css for mweb, tab and dweb.
Will write code considering performance as compared to this code. -->

<!-- In this project I don't think redux is necessary but still I used it considering instruction. And as per my point of view here we can use context instead of redux. -->

<!-- I can achieve infinite scroll using react-query. But considering PWA, pagination works more because infinite scroll will work in mobile as user friendly as it is. -->

<!-- images which are coming from api are not working may be I am not aware about baseUrl of image. Hence I added bydefault image in webp and if voting for movie is zero then I am not showing that on FE considering user perspective. -->

<!-- I used rem instead of px considering performance. -->
